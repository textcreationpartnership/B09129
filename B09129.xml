            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Before the Arrival of Admiral <hi>Evertſen,</hi> it was agreed between the Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould have the Van-guard, which was in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to do them Honour; but at the bottom, to conceal <hi>Torrington</hi>'s Deſigns, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been under Sail about Two or Three Hours, they were obliged to come to an Anchor, by reaſon of the Foggs and bad Weather: But ſoon after they perceived the <hi>French</hi> Fleet to bear up towards them, with the Wind at Eaſt-Immediately they weighed Anchor, and endeavoured to gain the Weather-gage, which they did with that ſucceſs, that <hi>Torrington</hi> gave the Signal for the firſt Squadron to Engage, but the <hi>French</hi> thought fit to retire. The 6, 7 8, and 9th. the Two Fleets were always in view of one another; but in regard the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was much the ſtronger, both for Number and bigueſs of Ships, it was judged moſt proper not to fight in the open Sea, and <hi>Torrington</hi> did his part ſo well, that he avoided engaging till he was come to the <hi>Beveſier,</hi> which was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable for his Purpoſe. And there it was that he received the Queen's Orders, not to delay Engaging, if the Wind and Weather would permit, which was the Reaſon that upon the 10th. by break of day, we went to ſeek the Enemy, who expected us in order of Battel, and ſo by nine of the Clock, the Engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan between the Blew Squadron of the <hi>French,</hi> and the Van-guard of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and both ſides fired deſperately for Three Hours together, till the <hi>French</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron not liking their Entertainment, bore away with all the tack they could make; but about one there happened a Calm, which not only prevented the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Purſuit, but put them into a little Diſorder; upon which, the <hi>French</hi> (whom the ſame Calm hindred from getting away, were conſtrained to begin the Fight again, which laſted till five a Clock in the Evening, with an incredible Fury. As for what concerns the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> moſt certainly, unleſs it were ſome few Veſſels that fought againſt <hi>Torrington</hi>'s Order, the reſt did nothing at all: So that the main Body of the <hi>French</hi> fell into the Rear of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet; ſo that having fought from Morning till Evening, and having defended themſelves ſo long againſt ſuch a prodigious Number of the Enemy, that aſſailed them on every ſide, they were ſo very much batter'd, that hardly Three were capable of making any Defence; which conſtrained them to make their way through the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and bear away to the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> between <hi>Beveſier</hi> and <hi>Ferly;</hi> Admiral <hi>Frackel, Jean Dick,</hi> and Captain <hi>Northey</hi> were ſlain; the <hi>Vreiſlandt</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt all her Maſts, and not being to be towed off by reaſon of the Calm, was taken towards the end of the Fight. Admiral <hi>Evertſen</hi> gave this Teſtimony of all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers and Soldiers, That there was not one that did not exactly perform his Duty; and as for the Admiral himſelf, though he would not ſpeak his own Praiſe, in his Letter to the States; yet all Men give him this Character, That he ſignalized himſelf by the greateſt Actions that a true Valour could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, and which deſerve an equal Fame with that of <hi>Trump</hi> or <hi>de Ruyter.</hi> In ſhort, it was never heard that ever Twenty two Ships fought ſo long againſt Fourſcore and Two, of which Seventeen carried no leſs than ſome Fourſcore and ſome an hundred Guns.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had we known no more than what the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Holland</hi> out of his Modeſty writes, we had known nothing at all: But in a Letter which a perſon of Honour in <hi>England</hi> wrote to the Lord <hi>Durſly,</hi> there is this Expreſſion, which better informs us, <hi>That the</hi> Holland <hi>Squadron behaved themſelves with ſo much Bravery, that if the Lord</hi> Torrington <hi>had done his Duty, in all probability we had won an abſolute Victory.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had but Two Captains ſlain, and Three Ships diſabled, which are thought to be the only Ships that fought without the Lord <hi>Torrington</hi>'s Order.</p>
